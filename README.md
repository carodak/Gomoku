Realization:  A Renju game that is played alone or in pairs. We used Code::Blocks with SFML library (C++).

Please kindly notice that the game was created during my second year of bachelor at Universit√© de Montpellier in France. We were a team of 4 people and had (at the time) written classes and comments in French.

Objectives:

- Create a game where two players can play a game of Gomoku.
- Implement the MinMax algorithm so that a player can play alone against an AI
- Improve the MinMax algorithm using the alpha-beta pruning technique
- Implement a specific variant of Gomoku (Renju)

Classes:

Below are the different classes of our game.

- Pions: A cell may have a pion
- Cellule: A grid is composed of cells
- Grille: Our Gomoku grid
- Curseur: Get where the cursor is
- IA: Algorithm MinMax, Alpha-beta pruning
- Joueur: Our player
- Menu: Main menu when you start the game  

I encourage you to see the code for more details.
